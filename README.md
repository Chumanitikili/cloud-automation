# Welcome to My Cloud Automation Project

Hey there! I’m thrilled to share my latest project with you. Here’s the scoop on how to get started.

## Project Info

## What’s This Project Built With?

I picked some tools I really enjoy working with to make this project fast and flexible:
- Vite (for lightning-fast builds)
- TypeScript (to keep my code organized and safe)
- React (because components are just fun)
- shadcn-ui (for clean, customizable UI bits)
- Tailwind CSS (to style things without breaking a sweat)


## Can I Use a Custom Domain?

You bet! To hook up a custom domain, go to the project’s Settings, look for the Domains section, and hit Connect Domain. It’s straightforward, but if you want a deeper dive, there are guides online about setting up custom domains.

That’s the rundown! I’m pumped to see what you do with this project. Explore, tweak, or even turn it into something totally new—let’s make something awesome together! If you hit any snags, just ping me.
